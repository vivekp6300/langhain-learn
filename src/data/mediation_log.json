The motor was not installed. An alternate plumber again confirmed that the offered space was suitable, but Sadhna rejected it.\nAlso, the bathroom backflow issue, earlier resolved on 30th April, recurred. Immediately after the fight, Sadhna called Ruchi's contractor demanding it be fixed. Contractor advised her to have her own plumber look at it first.\nLegal Advice: Ruchi's husband contacted their lawyer to confirm:\nThere was no mutually agreed alternative space.\nThe current space was not unsafe, just disputed.\nThe agreement provided no mechanism for unresolved disagreements.

This occurred with the full knowledge of Mrs. Sadhna Sharma, despite prior and repeated communication by the Ground Floor residents that no unauthorised vehicles are permitted within the property. It is noted that even the Ground Floor residents do not allow such entry for their own use.\nThe incident was raised on-site by Ruchi Sharma Pandey's labourers with Mrs. Sadhna Sharma, who acknowledged the violation and apologised. However, given the prolonged presence of the vehicle and her awareness of its entry and stay, the explanation of it being a \"mistake\" does not align with the facts.\nAdditionally, on the same day, the flooring work of the First Floor balcony was completed, including the stonework that had to be laid as part of the finishing tasks.\nThe dismantling of the damaged plaster of the Mumti walls on the terrace also continued on 20th May 2025 as part of the ongoing repair work.\nFurthermore, the scaffolding installed on the First Floor for the Angan work was completely removed on 20th May 2025. The damage to the walls was repaired, and the area was thoroughly cleaned. With this, the Angan-related work stands completed as of 20th May 2025."

The labourers politely informed her that the water logging was not caused by any work being done by them, nor was it due to water coming from the terrace.\nIn response, Mrs. Sadhna Sharma became very angry and threatened the labourers, saying she would file a formal complaint against them.\nIt may be noted that earlier, Ruchi Sharma Pandey's contractor had arranged for the entire drainage pipe of Sadhna Sharma's bathroom to be thoroughly cleaned by a team from the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). Given the circumstances, it appears prima facie that the drainage pipe may have become clogged again."

During the course of the work, Sadhna Sharma entered Ruchi's terrace without any permission and recorded a full video of all the solar materials stored there. This was done without any consent and constitutes an intrusion into Ruchi Sharma Pandey's exclusive property.\nFollowing this, Sadhna Sharma called the police to the premises and attempted to get the installation stopped.\nHowever, when the police arrived, the situation was calmly explained to them—that the terrace in question was solely under the ownership and control of Ruchi Sharma Pandey. Upon understanding this, the police did not interfere further and left the premises without taking any action.\nImmediately after the police departed, Ruchi Sharma Pandey went to the local police station and filed a formal complaint against Sadhna Sharma, stating that she was harassing them and attempting to obstruct the lawful solar installation work.\nIt is also recorded that during the police visit, Sadhna Sharma made contradictory and dangerous claims about the terrace. Initially, she asserted that the terrace belonged to her. However, when questioned further, she shifted her position and described the terrace as \"disputed property.\" This is factually incorrect. As per the Will of Late Vishnu Kumar Sharma, the terrace and the entire Ground Floor are owned by Ruchi Sharma Pandey. She has full legal rights to install any structure or utilities on the terrace, provided they do not interfere with the limited easement rights granted to Sadhna Sharma."

Ruchi Sharma Pandey subsequently filed a second formal police complaint against Sadhna for repeated obstruction, false accusations, and interference with court-sanctioned work. In the evening around 7:00 PM, police visited again at Sadhna's request, spoke with both parties, and advised peaceful continuation of work. Due to these disruptions and constant nuisance, solar installation progressed very slowly, with only 20-30% of the planned work completed. Separately, scaffolding was installed on the terrace to facilitate dismantling and replastering of higher wall sections."

This beam frame was critical to support the solar panel structure and enable integration with the final slab. Due to prior disruptions caused by Sadhna Sharma, this work—which should have taken just one day—was already delayed by several days. With monsoon season approaching, the delays posed a serious risk to the overall construction. In parallel, repair and replastering of the staircase also continued throughout the day."

The solar inverter was fixed to the staircase landing, and solar panel installation itself commenced. Concrete laying for the Barsati roof slab also began and was completed the same day. Thanks to the legal assurance provided to MYSUN, the vendor worked without interruption, marking the first full and productive day of solar installation after multiple days of obstruction."

Nonetheless, the work resumed. Curing of the newly laid Barsati roof slab was initiated with proper water filling. Gola moulding was constructed along the roof edges for effective drainage. Solar installation work continued smoothly, and the remaining six solar panels on the Mumtee terrace were successfully installed. Only the electrical wiring remained pending."

            "details": "Earthing pit digging for the solar installation was undertaken, during which workers encountered the main Delhi Jal Board water supply lines. The pits and rods were positioned carefully to avoid any interference with the pipeline. Meanwhile, curing of the Barsati roof slab continued. Staircase repair had reached the first-floor level near Sadhna Sharma's unit, where damaged wall sections were being broken and dismantled. Separately, the newly installed water tanks of Sadhna Sharma began overflowing due to the absence of an auto shut-off or alarm system. She had turned on the water supply motor but forgot to switch it off, resulting in prolonged overflow that flooded the central open-to-sky area on the ground floor and disrupted ongoing work.\nAdditionally, Vivek Pandey (on behalf of Ruchi) sent an email to the MYSUN solar team to confirm whether they had applied for the feasibility approval from TPDDL (Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited), which is a mandatory precondition before solar panel systems can be connected for net metering. The concern was that if feasibility clearance had not been secured, the net metering process could face delays or outright rejection. As per prior assurances, the MYSUN team had promised to refund the entire project amount in case the net metering process failed due to lack of such feasibility."

This included scraping off loose plaster, repairing damaged wall sections, and preparing the surface for a fresh plaster coat along the staircase passage.\nOn the same day, Sadhna Sharma again called Ruchi's contractor and pressured him to help clean the drains of her bathroom. She had not arranged for her own plumber. The contractor informed her that the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) team was currently occupied due to Eid-related backlogs and city-wide pending works, and would likely be available only after the 10th of June.\nAdditionally, Ruchi's electrician visited the site to install an Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB), as requested by the MYSUN solar team. The ELCB is a critical safety device that disconnects the power supply in the event of a current leak to prevent electric shock or fire hazards—especially important in solar systems due to their constant DC-AC interfacing. However, the solar vendor's on-site workers told the electrician that they would handle the installation themselves, along with all other electrical connections. They took possession of the ELCB device from Ruchi's electrician and retained it for integration during their next round of work.\nFinally, on this date, Sadhna Sharma's plumber shifted her old water motor to the newly designated location near the underground tank, in accordance with the mediation agreement."

When Ruchi's contractor requested that Sadhna Sharma temporarily remove her CCTV cameras and wiring from the staircase wall so that replastering could be completed smoothly, she refused. As a result, a patch of the wall remains untreated.\nAdditionally, since Sadhna had still not begun painting the outer walls, Ruchi's team expressed concern that finishing the terrace before Sadhna's painting work could lead to damage later. It was decided that unless Sadhna begins the work now, she will not be allowed to use the finished terrace for painting access later; instead, scaffolding from the ground will be required.\nOn the same day, further digging in the old terrace bathroom revealed deep concealed cracks in the wall structure, which were sealed using waterproofing compound. Repair and replastering work of the staircase also continued on this day. Putty work on the terrace also continued on this day."
