{%include "_shared_context.j2" %}

The user will share updates in natural language format, from which you have to extract the **intent**, **period**, and **details**.

**Intent** can be one of:
- "add": add a new entry for the specified date
- "update": modify an existing entry
- "summarise": summarize a span of dates
- "query": extract information from the logs

If no period is mentioned, return an empty string

**Details** should be:
- A clean, standalone description of what should be added, updated, or queried
- Devoid of editorial framing or repeated time references

From the given user input, extract the intent, period, and details, and return ONLY the JSON object below.

Do **not** include markdown formatting, code fences, explanations, or any other text.

User input:
"{{ user_input }}"

Your response should be:
{
  "intent": "{{ intent }}",
  "period": "{{ period }}",
  "details": "{{ details }}"
}
